#### User Accounts <a name='a2'></a>

MacPatch supports 2 different accounts not including the default admin account. MacPatch supports standard database accounts and LDAP/Active Directory accounts. 

<a name='a2a'></a>
##### Local Accounts
To add or remove a standard account, navigate to the Admin->Accounts menu. Simply click on the "+" icon just above the accounts table.

Assiging rights to a user account is fairly straight forward. If no rights are assigned the user can login and create a Client group and a patch group. This user will also be the owner of these groups and can assign additional users who can assist in managing these options. 

<a name='a2b'></a>
##### Directory Accounts
MacPatch supports user accounts coming from LDAP/Active directory. During the server setup you were asked if you wanted to enable LDAP user support. If you answered "Yes", then all of your settings were entered in to the "siteconfig.json" file. The settings are under the "ldap" key.

By default any user in the directory is allowed to login to MacPatch. This user will have the basic standard user rights. If you wish to limit directory users who can log in to the MacPatch admin console you will need to populate to keys in the "ldap" dictiobnary. First you will need to enable the "enableGroupFilter" attribute by setting it to "true". Then you will need to edit the "groupFilter" attribute. This attribute is a list, and is just the name the LDAP group. 

Example: 
`"groupFilter": ['Group1', 'Group2']`

Assiging rights to ldap users is just like a standard account. The only difference is the user has to login at least one time so that the user will show in the accounts table.
