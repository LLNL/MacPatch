#Client Documentation

##Deployment
The deployment of the client is fairly straightforward and simple. The client installer is in the Apple PKG format. With the installer being in this format you have the option of using something like Apple Remote Desktop. Once the client is deployed you can accept the client default settings or push out a custom property list file (plist), with your desired settings.

##Usage
The MacPatch application does not take a lot of steps to get it up and running. By default if you install the client and leave it in the default client group it will be patched daily at 12:30PM and it will receive the entire vendor recommended patches and updates. If you want to take the product and make it work for you and to see what's going on in your environment you'll need to do some customizing. The first thing I would recommend is organizing your clients by putting then in a Client Group. This is done my changing the "Domain" property value in the gov.llnl.mpagent.plist.
