======================================================

Author: Ian Lee <lee1001@llnl.gov>

Started by following the tutorial found here:

## Setup / History

This branch is the upstream branch of the Jekyll-OneLab LLNL collaboration
project. This template can be updated by rebasing (or merging) the changes from
upstream at: https://mystash.llnl.gov/projects/LWDS/repos/jekyll-onelab/browse

This uses Jekyll to build static HTML based on Markdown text files.

## Quickstart

Assuming working on OS X, tested on OS X 10.11.2. `gem` (Ruby package manager)
was preinstalled, so just working from there:

    # Install the dependencies:
    $ gem install jekyll
    $ gem install rdiscount

    # Build and serve the website
    # jekyll serve

    # Browse to (by default) `localhost:4000` in a web browser

## Release

This Jekyll theme is released under the MIT License. For more details see the
LICENSE File.
